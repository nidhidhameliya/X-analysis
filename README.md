# 🧠 Mental Health Trends Analysis via Social Media Data
This project focuses on analyzing mental health trends using social media data. It extracts posts containing mental health-related keywords from various platforms and applies data science techniques like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, correlation detection, and trend forecasting. The final insights are visualized through graphs and a Power BI dashboard.

# 📌 Project Objectives
Collect Social Media Data
Scrape or extract public posts containing mental health keywords (e.g., depression, anxiety, stress) from platforms like Twitter, Reddit, or Instagram using APIs or datasets.

Perform Sentiment Analysis
Use NLP models to evaluate emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral) to understand public perception and emotion trends toward mental health.

Topic Modeling
Apply techniques like LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to discover recurring themes and topics in posts (e.g., therapy, medication, loneliness, burnout).

Detect Correlations
Explore the correlation between sentiment changes and real-world events (e.g., COVID-19, exam seasons, natural disasters). Identify spikes in posts during specific timeframes.

Predict Mental Health Trends
Use historical data patterns to forecast future mental health discussion trends and identify geographical hotspots where specific mental health issues are prevalent.

Visualize Trends
Generate visualizations such as:

Sentiment over time line charts

Word clouds and bar charts of top themes

Heatmaps showing geographical mental health intensity

Topic distribution pie charts

Power BI Dashboard
Create an interactive Power BI dashboard showcasing:

Monthly trends in mental health-related posts

Sentiment distribution

Region-wise issue comparison

Real-time keyword tracker (optional)
